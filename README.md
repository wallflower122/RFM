## Customer Segmentation via RFM Analysis in UK Online Retail

Welcome to the **Customer Segmentation via RFM Analysis in UK Online Retail** project repository. In this project, we dive into the "Online Retail II" dataset from Kaggle, uncovering valuable insights about transactions within a UK-based online gift-ware retailer spanning December 2009 to December 2011. Our focus extends to both individual and wholesale customers, as we embark on a journey of understanding and segmentation.

### Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find the code, documentation, and visualizations that form the backbone of our analysis. The main steps of our project include:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, meticulously handling missing values and ensuring accurate data types. This foundational step sets the stage for the rest of our analysis.

2. **RFM Analysis**: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values are calculated to delve into customer behavior. By understanding when, how often, and how much customers purchase, we lay the groundwork for insightful segmentation.

3. **Data Normalization**: Utilizing StandardScaler, we normalize the RFM data, ensuring fairness in our subsequent K-Means clustering. Normalization is key to accurate customer grouping.

4. **K-Means Clustering**: Applying K-Means clustering, we identify distinct customer clusters with similar purchasing patterns. This step categorizes customers based on their RFM profiles, allowing us to draw meaningful insights.

5. **Visualization**: The culmination of our analysis is visually represented through a scatterplot, where customer segments are vividly illustrated. This visualization provides an intuitive view of our data-driven categorization.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required libraries by installing them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Notebook**: Navigate to the notebook `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. This notebook encapsulates our analysis, step by step.

### Results

Our analysis culminates in a nuanced understanding of customer behavior within the UK online retail landscape. The derived customer segments provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making, personalized marketing approaches, and optimization of inventory management.
